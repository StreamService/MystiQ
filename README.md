Introduction
------------

MystiQ is a GUI for [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org), a powerful media converter.
FFmpeg can read audio and video files in various formats and convert them into
other formats. MystiQ features an intuitive graphical interface and a rich set
of presets to help you convert media files within a few clicks. Advanced users
can also adjust conversion parameters in detail.

For compiling and installing MystiQ, please refer to [INSTALL](INSTALL).
